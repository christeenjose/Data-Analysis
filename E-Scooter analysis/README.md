#Dataset

The data consist of approximately 239111 bike rides of April 2019. The attributes include the trip
start/end time, start/end station, duration in seconds as well as additional information such as user
type, gender, and birth date. Some unwanted data points were removed from the dataset to make
the set more readable like longitude latitude etc.

#Summary of Findings In the exploration

I found that there are two types of clients using the system: subscribers who are mainly uses this
service for short duration trips and customers who are mainly uses this service tourism purposes,
Here we found that more aged users are fall under the subscriber category and subscribers are using
this service almost for short trips. Most of the users renting bikes from station id less than 100 and
the surprising factor is more teenagers use a particular station id around 250.From the age vs gender
graph we found that some users with 100 years of age are using this services and they fall under the
subscriber category. To conclude we can see that most of the users are under the age 20-40.

#Key Insights for Presentation For the presentation

I move to daily and weekly habits of customers. I use the heatmap to show the relation between
age and stations. Also I used violin plot and scatter plot to show the behaviour of age with other
attributes. Here we found that users with less age taking more longer trips. To finish, I introduce a
category plot to show the difference in age group of subscribers and customers . we found that
males with 100 years of age in subscriber group using this services.
